Faker is an easy to use library for generating fake, yet realistically looking data for testing, preparing presentations,  creating screenshots, obfuscating data, and many more.

More classes will be added over time.

# Locale
To set the locale use property [`Config.Locale`](https://github.com/RimuTec/Faker/wiki/Class-Config). Default for the library is "en".

# Name Clashes
In case of name clashes with other classes in your code base or in 3rd party libraries, use one of [these techniques](https://github.com/RimuTec/Faker/wiki/Name-Clashes).
